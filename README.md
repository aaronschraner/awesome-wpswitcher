#awesome-wpswitcher
My AwesomeWM config with fan control, wallpaper switching, and a massive list of hotkeys

###To those of you who want to use this:

1. change the wallpaper folder and safewp locations

2. comment out or delete everything related to kuhler_ctl (unless you have the same liquid cooler as me and kuhler_ctl installed)
3. Don't use triple monitor wallpapers on single monitor setups or you will get errors.
4. You can use single monitor wallpapers on multi monitor setups.
5. For multi-monitor wallpapers: you need to separate the image into different files, one per screen, titled 1.png, 2.png, etc. and put all the images in a folder titled the name of the wallpaper. I will create a shell script with ImageMagick to do this automatically later.
6. You need to install blingbling or comment out that block of code.
